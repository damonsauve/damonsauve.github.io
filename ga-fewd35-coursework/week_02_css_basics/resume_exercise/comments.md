Here's where you can find my comments on you work as you progress...always look for the comments.md file :)

This is really good! Not only did you manage to clone the about me page, but you explored and added new elements not covered in class. I especially like the square bullets, and that you personalized it to your experience.

Your documents are also very organized spacially with white space and indentation.

Great job!
