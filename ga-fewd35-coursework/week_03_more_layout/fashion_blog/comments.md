Damon -- great work man! This is a perfect clone, everything looks amazing. I also like your folder structure...clear separation of concerns to keep everything organized.

Your index file looks good too. Clear spacing, everything is clearly organized, and your labels for classes, ids, and choice of elements make sense.

The CSS file is also in pretty good shape -- clean, organized, and you're using selectors we haven't covered in class. The only thing I have a note about is to think about code resuability here...you have a lot of places where you're using 'margin: 0 0 0 0', same for padding. Think of ways to write things like this less by applying it in universal ways. Remember DRY -- Don't repeat yourself. A good deal of coding is about being lazy ;)
